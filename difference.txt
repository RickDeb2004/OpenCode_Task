Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track of different versions of your code. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and a community of developers to collaborate and contribute to open-source projects. It was founded in 2008 and is built on top of Git.

In simple terms, Git is a tool, while GitHub is a service for projects that use Git. With GitHub, you can store your Git repositories online, manage them, and collaborate with others on coding projects.
